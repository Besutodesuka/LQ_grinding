# My sample project

For ielts practice

## V0.1 Requirement

- website assisting on generating english exercise for me
- v0.1 I will complete functionallity of generating writing part 1 exam (academic)
- Multi page with nav bar all other page are disable
- When on listening page there is feild for generating question
    - You can give pre define context/ or leave it as null →
        - for few shot
        - scope if not given then random select via CoT
    - When generate btn is pressed, the website will sent the request to gemini free api with json response structure
        - (this can be handle using middleware/callback/micro service)
        - On client side, async, promise and await should be appiled
    - Upon receiving the error, it will alert. and if there is data, It will compile the code in response to create graph
    - I will use facade pattern to orchestrate the generation process
        - GeminiClient
        - Database Client
    - upon generation complete the record will be added to the database (postgres/mongo)
    - Upon load get method will call with limit 10 on question and show at the side bar
        - We can select the tile on the left to contiue exercise
    - in center of page, it will have text feild that will be resilent to closure of the application while maintain performance
    - With real time word count
    - On the bottom it will have an button for requesting llm as judge grading
    - There should be setting tab for adding the llm setting (model version, prompt)
        - These setting should apply **factory**/builder design pattern to create the judge object
    - animation while awaiting is call is also cool

## architecture

- Question generator: facade
- Llmjudge: factory (LLMSetting)
- Logger (middleware)
- General Setting from .env (singleton)
- Graph generator (CB function for question generator upon receiving response)
    - → micro service in python/ client side compile
- LLMSetting (singleton)
    - Purpose: enum (question gen|judge)
    - Llm name,
    - Provider
    - Prompt
- DB client: middleware (local db → frontend),facade, singleton
    - Get(query, limit = 10)
    - Post
        - add question(id, question, answer, judge)
        - Update question(id, question, answer, judge)
    - DELETE question(id)
- GeminiClient: (frontend → FastAPI server → gemini) middleware, facade, singleton
- Word count as call back function with reactivity (proxy pattern?)
